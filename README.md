#MANA-Poll

>Our application, called MANA-Poll, is a free polling and clicker system. We wanted to create a consistent clicker system that could ideally be used across UW. It provides flexibility to poll your class or evaluate understanding of course content. When users sign in, they can indicate whether they are a student or a teacher, as the view and features will be different depending on their selection. Teachers can generate and post multiple choice questions for their specific class. Students would then answer the questions and submit their answers on their computer or on mobile. Then, the teacher will be able to view the results in the form of progress bars. During the development process our application went through a few changes since we wrote our Project Proposal. To reflect these changes we have defined new user stories that our application aims to achieve:

>As a student, I want to be able to view and answer questions so I can show my understanding and participate in class. 

>As a teacher, I want to be able to instantly ask students questions in order to see if they are learning and to make sure they are participating in class. 

>As a teacher, I want to be able to view the results of a clicker question to see if the students understand the content or if I need to review the topic. 

##Additional Comments
> Our app is relatively simple but we put quite a lot of effort into it. We hope that it shows, and we want to say thank you Cameron and Joel for a very good quarter!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
